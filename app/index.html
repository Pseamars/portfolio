                <h2>The Tuscany Tavern</h2>
                <p>My first Job. I grew up at the Tuscany Tavern. I moved up from bus boy to barender in the front of the house and from dishwasher to running the kitchen a few nights a week in the back of the house. There was no position I did not hold at this restaurant. I learned about work ethic and what it means to do a quality job here. I also grew up socially and gained many perspectives that were vastly different from my own. I moved on from the Tuscany Tavern after having worked there for 8 years to essentially 'leave the nest'.</p>

                <p>I first worked at the Keg as a bar back, winning an award for 'Best Bar Back 2007'. I eventually moved up to a bartender for a short period and spent the majority of my time as a server. I also trained new staff and helped with the formation of a charity group within the restaurant. I learned a lot about myself and customer service with this experience, especially about sales. I quit when I graduated college because I was about to begin teaching.</p>

                <h2>Jefferson High School</h2>
                <p>I was a tutor for the AVID tutoring program. In this position I helped students with their homework, not through giving them the answer, but rather through an inquiry process modelled after the Socratic Method. I learned the importance of developing meaningful relationships with students and colleagues as well as that guiding people to the answer is much more powerful than giving them the answer.</p>

                <h2>Metropolitan State University of Denver</h2>
                <p>I graduated from Metro State University of Denver in May of 2012. I achieved a 3.77 GPA with a degree in Spanish and a teaching certificate for K-12 education. This is particularly impressive because I did not graduate high school and am the first in my family to graduate college. I particularly enjoyed classes in the humanities and was pleasantly surprised by a sparked interest in math and science.</p>

                <h2>Manual High School</h2>
                <p>I taught Spanish as a Foreign language, Spanish Heritage and ESL. I created my own curriculum for each of these sections and developed my own standards based assessments. I was also the Technology and Google Champion, teaching with 1:1 devices in my classroom, and also hosted professional development sessions that tutored teachers on how to use technology in the classroom. In addition to my work as a teacher, I participated in several optional professional development opportunities and commitees. I gained many skills and insights from this position that have greatly influenced my abilities and ambitions."</p>

                    <hr class="medium">
                        <p>I have been working with HTML, CSS and JavaScript as I learn how to program. I have used many online resources, such as<a href="http://teamtreehouse.com/patrickseamars" target="_blank"> Treehouse</a>, <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/webSurfer60902" target="_blank"> Code Academy</a> and <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/users/773221" target="_blank"> Code School</a>, as well as <abbr title="Jon Duckett Books, Eloquent JavaSript, JavaScript the Good Parts">text books </abbr>and fellow web programmers. I have been involved in local Frontend Developer Meetups and immerse myself in the world of code through blogs and podcasts. While I don't have much to show in terms of projects as of yet, I have an active GitHub account, link below, where you can find some of my learning.</p>

                        <p>I aim to become a full-stack developer, but would like to focus more on the front end. I have a deep interest in learning Ruby and PHP, as well as continuing to learn about all that JavaScript has to offer, including NodeJs. My current path is to buildup and master the language of the web before I venture to the backend.  </p>

                            <li>HTML5</li>
